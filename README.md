Albathor
========

This is the place where an Albacore generator temporarily named `albathor` is being built.  

A solid skeleton is now in place and a working example.  

To try out the example:

	$ git clone git://github.com/jondot/albathor.git
        $ bundler install
	$ rake install
	$ cd examples/actionpack
	$ go
	
This example uses the template in http://pastie.org/pastes/1747823/text. In it, it will download
and use NUnit.
